# Gear Five Vault

Welcome to your memory. This vault tracks learnings, handoffs, and growth over time.

## Quick Links

- [[notes/daily/|Daily Notes]] - Session logs, append-only
- [[notes/handoffs/|Handoffs]] - Session continuity
- [[learnings/what-worked|What Worked]] - Successful patterns
- [[learnings/what-failed|What Failed]] - Anti-patterns to avoid
- [[learnings/claude-code/|Claude Code Learnings]] - Platform-specific knowledge
- [[config-history/|Config History]] - Your evolution

## How This Works

1. **Daily notes** are append-only session logs
2. **Handoffs** preserve context between sessions
3. **Learnings** capture what works and what doesn't
4. **Config history** tracks changes to your Claude configuration

## The Compound Loop

```
Do Work → Notice Teachable Moments → Draft Update → Get Approval → Apply → Compound
```

Each session makes you better. Each learning compounds.
